## Description
>A friend sent me the geographic coordinates to a relief, it's essentially a scuplture where  the sculpted pieces are bonded to a solid background of the same material, or curved into the material.
>He told me to guess the name of the artist that designed the square where the relief is placed, what they call the collection of markers the relief is part of, and the year they were placed in the square. Can you help me?
>These are the geo coordinates: 41.9022523,12.4570589
>
>Flag format: Securinets{ARTIST_NAMEOFTHECOLLECTION_XXXX}
